# Codeforces_Raif_ML
The competition took place in May, 2021 <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1522/problem/A" target="_blank">(link)</a>.


The goal was to optimise the betting strategy on football (soccer) matches according to teams stats and some other provided information. There was no need to save the predictions, just to immidiately print them, thus the data folder consists only of stats files from raw data, no "interim" or "output" folders were created.

There were restrictions at model performance time and total memory, which also influenced the solution.
